# Synthesized data

### Insight 1

The primary users of the app are at-risk groups like pregnant women, their partners, travelers, and couples trying to conceive. These groups have a strong need for timely and accurate health alerts regarding diseases like Zika that can severely impact fertility and fetal development.

From the surveys and [literature review](../user-research/literature-review.md), we see these groups express anxiety over health risks and a desire for resources to help them take recommended precautions. The [competitive analysis](../user-research/competitive-analysis.md) also shows other health alert apps targeting these audiences with features for custom alerts, location-based notifications, and health tips.

### Insight 2

Users want an app that provides localized, customized alerts and information to help them assess risk levels and take appropriate action. Generic, one-size-fits-all health alerts are not useful and can be ignored.

In the surveys, users noted the need for "relevant alerts tailored to my needs and location. **"The literature review found that personalized health messaging and location-based risk information were most effective"**. The top-rated competitive apps allowed users to input personal details and locations to receive customized alerts and maps showing local disease activity.

### Recommendations

The app should allow users to input personal details like locations frequented, travel destinations, pregnancy status, and other risk factors to receive tailored Zika alerts and health recommendations. Customization will make the app indispensable.

Work closely with health organizations to source official data on Zika outbreak locations and activity levels. Use maps and charts to show users their proximity to at-risk areas so they can take appropriate precautions or avoid those locations altogether if necessary.

Develop a content strategy with medically reviewed information on Zika transmission, symptoms, prevention, risks to fertility and pregnancy, treatment, and more. Users need a trusted resource for Zika education to understand alerts and take recommended actions.
