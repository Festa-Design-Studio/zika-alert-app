#### Accuracy and Timeliness

|                |                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kidenga        | <ul><li>Alerts based on crowd-sourced user reports may lack accuracy without verification</li><li>Timeliness depends on user participation; delays likely between actual events and alerts</li></ul> |
| Mosquito Alert | <ul><li>Alert accuracy enhanced through verification of user reports</li><li>Timeliness improved by frequent user participation across wide areas</li></ul>                                          |
| HealthMap      | <ul><li>Outbreak tracking from various sources provides accurate alerts</li><li>Automated system enables real-time alerts as outbreaks occur</li></ul>                                               |
| WHO Zika app   | <ul><li>Official WHO info ensures alert accuracy</li><li>Content updates provide timely new information</li><li>But lacks real-time outbreak alerts</li></ul>                                        |

In summary, apps relying on automated tracking of official data sources tend to provide the most accurate and timely alerts, while crowd-sourced apps are less reliable. Customization options are limited, with only a few apps enabling user preferences for alert timing, location, and disease type.
