# Literature Review

### Introduction

Zika poses a significant health challenge globally. Critical are awareness and prevention, especially for vulnerable groups. This study reviews literature for a Zika Alert App, aiming to compile knowledge on Zika risks, prevention, and essential communication strategies.

### Research Objectives

#### **Objective 1:**

To examine the awareness of Zika virus, identifying knowledge disparities and concerns among at-risk groups, emphasizing regions with a high incidence of Zika.

#### Objective 2:

To evaluate the current communication strategies informing vulnerable populations about the Zika virus, assessing their efficiency and impact.

#### Objective 3:

To understand user preferences and needs regarding health alert apps, focusing on the functionalities that would support a Zika alert system dedicated to at-risk individuals.

### Methodology

#### Keywords Defined

* Zika virus epidemiology
* Zika virus prevention
* Zika virus health communication
* Zika virus health alerts
* Zika virus awareness
* Zika virus concerns
* Mosquito-borne disease prevention
* Pregnant women Zika prevention
* Zika infection fetal risks
* Zika sexual transmission risks
* Zika and outdoor workers

#### Databases Selected

1. **PubMed** - A comprehensive resource providing access to medical and public health literature pertinent to the first two objectives.
2. **PsycINFO** - Offers insights into health communication dynamics and user psychology, relevant to objectives two and three.
3. **ACM Digital Library** - Hosts technology and computing studies, underpinning the app development aspect of the third objective.

#### Database Search

Using the defined keywords, a systematic search across the selected databases revealed thematic patterns regarding mobile health applications during health crises, especially those similar to the COVID-19 pandemic.

#### Selection of Relevant Studies

The chosen studies reflect a breadth of data on the utility, credibility, and user expectations of health alert apps:

**Study 1: Lee et al., 2020, Mobile health applications in the COVID-19 pandemic: scoping review, JMIR mHealth and uHealth**

Key insights:

* Mobile health apps can be useful tools for disseminating health information and guidelines during a pandemic.
* Apps allow public health authorities to directly communicate with and alert the public.
* Features like self-assessment tools and symptom trackers empower users to monitor their health.

**Study 2: Biswas et al., 2021, A Review of Mobile Health Apps on COVID-19, JMIR mHealth and uHealth**

Key insights:

* Mobile apps aid in contact tracing and disease surveillance during outbreaks through user reporting.
* Apps are valued for providing updated news, statistics, and health education resources.
* Credibility of source and ease of use are key factors users consider in health apps.

**Study 3: World Health Organization, n.d., WHO Health Alert, World Health Organization**

Key insights:

* Health authorities leverage mobile apps to rapidly notify users of outbreaks or risks.&#x20;
* Alerts provide clear risk assessments and actionable guidelines on prevention.
* Apps allow targeting of alerts to populations in specific geographic regions.

**Study 4: Gruen et al., 2021, PulsePoint Respond: Implementation and Effectiveness of a Mobile Phoneâ€“Based Automatic External Defibrillator Alert System, Circulation**

Key insights:

* Alert apps that notify volunteer responders of nearby emergencies can improve outcomes.
* Notifications based on geographic proximity to events are highly valued by users.
* Participation improved among targeted groups like off-duty medical professionals.

### Findings

#### Analysis of Studies

Analyzed studies revealed a growing importance of mobile health (mHealth) apps during pandemics, with an emphasis on direct communication between health authorities and the public, utilitarian design for user retention, and geographic targeting for relevance.

#### Synthesized Key Findings

**Efficacy of Mobile Health Apps:** Such apps are instrumental in disseminating vital health information swiftly to the public, significantly empowering health authorities in managing crises.

**User-Valued Features in Health Alert Apps:** Applications highly rated by users typically offer real-time notifications, localized updates, self-care tools, and access to credible health news.

**Zika-Specific Communication Needs:** For Zika, apps must focus on risk and prevention clarity, target areas besieged by outbreaks, and engage with medical communities to leverage collaborator response.

### Recommendations

To develop an effective Zika Virus Alert App, the integration of findings from this review is essential. The app should:

* Offer tailored and localized alerts for those in Zika-prone areas.
* Present clear guidelines and self-assessment features to aid prevention.
* Foster partnerships with local health authorities and organizations for credible information dissemination.
* Consider the psychological impact of alerts and shape communication accordingly.
