# Introduction

Welcome to the Zika Alert App project - an initiative dedicated to protecting individuals from the Zika virus through real-time information and alerts. Behind this epic health-tech endeavour is a dedicated team from Festa Design Studio.

### About Festa Design Studio

We are Festa Design Studio, a haven of creativity where art meets technology. Our core lies in graphic design, brand strategy, and immersive UX/UI experiences aimed at small and medium enterprises and nonprofits. Every brush stroke and pixel we lay down is a step towards blending aesthetics with functionality, ensuring that every story we tell is not just heard but felt and remembered.

### Meet Our Team

Diving head-on into the Zika Alert App project, we rallied our best minds and passionate hearts who believe in the difference design can make in the world:

#### Abayomi Ogundipe

Lead UX/UI Designer

#### Carlos Paolos

Assistant UX/UI Designer

Together, Abayomi and Carlos have utilized a robust toolkit to bring the Zika Alert App to fruition. From the strategic visualization on Whimsical to the intricate designs crafted in Adobe Illustrator and Figma, every tool has been leveraged to ensure that the end product is not just a tool but a lifeline.

### Our Commitment

Our journey through the development of the Zika Alert App has been one of relentless dedication. We are not just creating a product; we are crafting a solution designed to tackle the Zika threat head-on. It is our promise to deliver an app that not only educates but empowers users to take proactive measures against Zika, turning fear into awareness and awareness into action.

### Moving Forward

As we continue pushing the boundaries of design and technology at Festa Design Studio, our mission remains clear: to create meaningful, impactful, and engaging digital experiences. The Zika Alert App is just the beginning. We are on a mission to pave the way for a future where technology serves as a guardian, protector, and ally in every aspect of human life.
